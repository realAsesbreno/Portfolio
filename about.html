                Hello, My name is Andrei Justyn Sesbre√±o, an IT Student in St. Dominic College of Asia. I tend to be very passionate about video games 
                on how it is developed and documented during its development phase. And being able to see how the reaction of the people who get to try out
                these games is a joy to see. And I would love to also be involved when you want to hire me.
                
                An aspiring Web Designer, Game Developer, and Hardware Engineer. I hope to be featured and involved in your future projects
                and work alongside you.
            </p>
